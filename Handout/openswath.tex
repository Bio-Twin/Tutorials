\section{OpenSWATH}
\subsection{Introduction}

OpenSWATH~\cite{Rost2014fd} is a module of OpenMS that allows analysis of LC-MS/MS DIA (data independent acquisition) data using the approach described by Gillet \textit{et~al.}~\cite{Gillet2012Targeted}. The DIA approach described there uses 32 cycles to iterate through precursor ion windows from 400-426 Da to 1175-1201 Da and at each step acquires a complete, multiplexed fragment ion spectrum of all precursors present in that window. After 32 fragmentations (or 3.2 seconds), the cycle is restarted and the first window (400-426 Da) is fragmented again, thus delivering complete ``snapshots'' of all fragments of a specific window every 3.2 seconds.

The analysis approach described by Gillet et al. extracts ion traces of specific fragment ions from all MS2 spectra that have the same precursor isolation window, thus generating data that is very similar to SRM traces.

\subsection{Installation of OpenSWATH}
OpenSWATH has been fully integrated since OpenMS 1.10 \cite{Kohlbacher2007,Sturm2008,Bertsch2011OpenMS}).

\subsection{Installation of mProphet}
mProphet (\url{http://www.mprophet.org/}) \cite{Reiter2011MProphet} is available as standalone script in \directory{External\_Tools/mProphet/}. 
R (\url{http://www.r-project.org/}) and the package MASS (\url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MASS/}) are further required to execute mProphet. 
Please obtain a version for either Windows, Mac or Linux directly from CRAN. \\

\noindent PyProphet, a much faster reimplementation of the mProphet algorithm is available from PyPI (\url{https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyprophet/}). The usage of pyprophet instead of mProphet is suggested for large-scale applications, but the installation requires more dependencies and therefore, for this tutorial the application of mProphet is described.

\subsection{Generating the Assay Library}
\subsubsection{Generating TraML from transition lists}
OpenSWATH requires the assay libraries to be supplied in the TraML format \cite{Deutsch2012TraMLA}. To enable manual editing of transition lists, the TOPP tool \OPENMSTOOL{ConvertTSVToTraML} is available that uses tab separated files as input. Example datasets are provided in \directory{OpenSWATH/assay/}. Please note that the transition lists need to be named \texttt{.csv} or \texttt{.tsv}.

The header of the transition list contains the following variables (with example values in brackets):

\begin{description}
  \item[Required Columns:]
  \item[\texttt{PrecursorMz}] \hfill \\
  The mass-to-charge (m/z) of the precursor ion. (728.88)
  \item[\texttt{ProductMz}] \hfill \\
  The mass-to-charge (m/z) of the product or fragment ion. (924.539)
   \item[\texttt{LibraryIntensity}] \hfill \\
  The relative intensity of the transition. (3305.3)
  \item[\texttt{NormalizedRetentionTime}] \hfill \\
  The \textbf{normalized} retention time (or iRT) \cite{Escher2012Using} of the peptide. (26.5)
  \newline
  \item[Targeted Proteomics Columns:]
  \item[\texttt{ProteinId}] \hfill \\
  A unique identifier for the protein. (AQUA4SWATH\_HMLangeA)
  \item[\texttt{PeptideSequence}] \hfill \\
  The unmodified peptide sequence. (ADSTGTLVITDPTR)
  \item[\texttt{ModifiedPeptideSequence}] \hfill \\
  The peptide sequence with UniMod modifications. (ADSTGTLVITDPTR(UniMod:267))
  \item[\texttt{PrecursorCharge}] \hfill \\
  The precursor ion charge. (2)
  \item[\texttt{ProductCharge}] \hfill \\
  The product ion charge. (2)
  \newline
  \item[Grouping Columns:]
  \item[\texttt{TransitionGroupId}] \hfill \\
  A \textbf{unique} identifier for the transition group.\\
  (AQUA4SWATH\_HMLangeA\_ADSTGTLVITDPTR(UniMod:267)/2)
  \item[\texttt{TransitionId}] \hfill \\
  A \textbf{unique} identifier for the transition.\\
  (AQUA4SWATH\_HMLangeA\_ADSTGTLVITDPTR(UniMod:267)/2\_y8)
  \item[\texttt{Decoy}] \hfill \\
  A binary value whether the transition is target or decoy (target:0, decoy:1). (0)
  \item[\texttt{PeptideGroupLabel}] \hfill \\
  Which label group the peptide belongs to. \\
  \item[\texttt{DetectingTransition}] \hfill \\
  Use transition for peak group detection. (1)\\
  \item[\texttt{IdentifyingTransition}] \hfill \\
  Use transition for peptidoform inference using IPF. (1)\\
  \item[\texttt{QuantifyingTransition}] \hfill \\
  Use transition to quantify peak group. (1)\\
\end{description}

\noindent For further instructions about generic transition list and assay library generation please see \url{http://openswath.org/en/latest/docs/generic.html}.
\newline
\noindent To convert transitions lists to TraML, use \OPENMSTOOL{ConvertTSVToTraML}:\\

\begin{description}
  \item[Linux or Mac] \hfill \\
    On the Terminal:
    \begin{lstlisting}
  TargetedFileConverter -in OpenSWATH_SGS_AssayLibrary.tsv -out OpenSWATH_SGS_AssayLibrary.TraML
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item[Windows] \hfill \\
    On the TOPP command line:
    \begin{lstlisting}
  TargetedFileConverter.exe -in OpenSWATH_SGS_AssayLibrary.tsv -out OpenSWATH_SGS_AssayLibrary.TraML
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Appending decoys to a TraML}
In addition to the target assays, OpenSWATH further requires decoy assays in the library which are later used for classification and error rate estimation. For the decoy generation it is crucial that the decoys represent the targets in a realistic but unnatural manner without interfering with the targets. The methods for decoy generation implemented in OpenSWATH include 'shuffle', 'pseudo-reverse', 'reverse' and 'shift'. To append decoys to a TraML, the TOPP tool \OPENMSTOOL{OpenSwathDecoyGenerator} can be used:

\begin{description}
  \item[Linux or Mac] \hfill \\
    On the Terminal:
    \begin{lstlisting}
  OpenSwathDecoyGenerator -in OpenSWATH_SGS_AssayLibrary.TraML -out OpenSWATH_SGS_AssayLibrary_with_Decoys.TraML -method shuffle
  \end{lstlisting}
  \item[Windows] \hfill \\
    On the TOPP command line:
    \begin{lstlisting}
  OpenSwathDecoyGenerator.exe -in OpenSWATH_SGS_AssayLibrary.TraML -out OpenSWATH_SGS_AssayLibrary_with_Decoys.TraML -method shuffle
  \end{lstlisting}
\end{description}

\subsection{OpenSWATH KNIME}
An example KNIME workflow for OpenSWATH is supplied in \directory{Workflows/} (Fig.~\ref{fig:openswath}). The example dataset can be used for this workflow (filenames in brackets):

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Open \directory{Workflows / OpenSWATH / OpenSWATH.zip} in KNIME: \menu{File > Import KNIME Workflow...}.
  \item Select the normalized retention time (iRT) assay library in TraML format by double-clicking on node \menu{Input File > iRT Assay Library}.\\
  (\directory{OpenSWATH/assay/OpenSWATH\_iRT\_AssayLibrary.TraML})
  \item Select the SWATH MS data in mzML format as input by double-clicking on node \menu{Input File > SWATH-MS files}.\\
  (\directory{OpenSWATH/data/split\_napedro\_L120420\_010\_SW-*.nf.pp.mzML})
  \item Select the target peptide assay library in TraML format  as input by double-clicking on node \menu{Input Files > Assay Library}.\\
  (\directory{OpenSWATH/assay/OpenSWATH\_SGS\_AssayLibrary.TraML})
  \item Set the output destination by double-clicking on node \menu{Output File}.\\
  \item Run the workflow.
\end{enumerate}

The resulting output can be found at your selected path, which will be used as input for mProphet. Execute the script on the Terminal (Linux or Mac) or cmd.exe (Windows) in \directory{OpenSWATH/result}:

\begin{lstlisting}
R --slave --args bin_dir=../../../External_Tools/mProphet/ mquest=OpenSWATH_output.csv workflow=LABEL_FREE num_xval=5 run_log=FALSE write_classifier=1 write_all_pg=1 < ../../../External_Tools/mProphet/mProphet.R
\end{lstlisting}

The main output will be called\\
\directory{OpenSWATH/result/mProphet\_all\_peakgroups.xls}\\
with statistical information available in\\
\directory{OpenSWATH/result/mProphet.pdf}.\\

Please note that due to the semi-supervised machine learning approach of mProphet the results differ slightly when mProphet is executed several times.

Additionally the chromatrogam output (.mzML) can be visualized for inspection with \OPENMSTOOL{TOPPView}.

\subsection{From the example dataset to real-life applications}
The sample dataset used in this tutorial is part of the larger SWATH MS Gold Standard (SGS) dataset which is described in the publication of Roest et al.~\cite{Rost2014fd}.
It contains one of 90 SWATH-MS runs with significant data reduction (peak picking of the raw, profile data) to make file transfer and working with it easier. Usually SWATH-MS datasets are huge with several gigabyte per run. Especially when complex samples in combination with large assay libraries are analyzed, the TOPP tool based workflow requires a lot of computational resources.
