\section{Troubleshooting guide}
This section will show you where you can turn to when you encounter any problems with this tutorial or with our
nodes in general. Please see the FAQ first. If your problem is not listed or the proposed solution does not work,
feel free to leave us a message at the means of support that you see most fit.

\subsection{FAQ}
\subsubsection{Platform-specific problems}
\paragraph{Linux}
Q: Stdlib problem on Linux
A: We currently build with gcc 4.8. We will try to extend our support for older Linuxes. Until then, build the
binaries yourself (see OpenMS documentation) and replace them in KNIME (TODO give folder)

Q: Configuration dialog on Linux
A: Unsolved, probably an X-Server problem

\paragraph{Windows}
Q: Prerequisites
A: Get the prerequisites installer or install NET and VCRedist yourself.

\subsubsection{Nodes}
Q: XTandem not working
A: For now: Give it the default configuration under TODO folder

Q: MSGFPlus and Luciphor
A: These are java processes that are started underneath. E.g. are not killed during cancellation of the node.
